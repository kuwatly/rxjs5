# RxJs 5

Playground for RxJs

## How to Load the App
The project uses Node.js.  If you do not have Node >= 6.x installed, you can download it here: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Once Node is installed, navigate to the directory where you want to store the app
```
git clone https://github.com/kuwatly/rxjs5.git
npm install
node_modules/.bin/typings install dt~es-shim --global
```
Once all of the dependencies have been installed you can launch the app with
```
npm start
```

A new browser window should automatically open displaying the app.  If it doesn't, navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser
